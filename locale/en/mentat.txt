#AtreidesAtreidesInfo
Our ancestral home is the lush planet of Caladan.
We have created a civilized society and we respect the lives and rights of all people.
We do not believe in the use of unnecessary violence, and have crafted a defensive alliance with the native Fremen of Dune.

#HarkonnenAtreidesInfo
The Harkonnen come from the dark planet of Giedi Prime.
They are cruel and vicious individuals, and do not assign much value to fair play or even human life.
Their goal is obviously the military conquest of Dune.

#OrdosAtreidesInfo
House Ordos was originally formed by a group of insecure wealthy families.
It has evolved into a powerful cartel that is driven by a lust for credits and the desire to control and manipulate.
They often support themselves by stealing rather than working.

#AtreidesHarkonnenInfo
The Atreides are spawned from the humid tropical planet of Caladan.
They are best known for their weaknesses of honesty and kindness.
They do not seem to believe in war and will usually avoid military conflicts.
They have befriended the natives of Dune, and may be expected to involve the local patriot Fremen in their defensive plans.

#HarkonnenHarkonnenInfo
We Harkonnen have come from the planet Giedi Prime.
We want now to possess Dune. Our weapons are powerful enough to deflect any attacks from our enemies.
All of House Harkonnen is concentrating on this task, and only a disaster could stop us now.

#OrdosHarkonnenInfo
This cartel of greedy families has been thrown together by the lust for power.
They will most likely be too busy bickering among themselves to be overly concerned with our forces.

#AtreidesOrdosInfo
The Atreides come from Caladan, a planet whose warm climate and over-productive agriculture undoubtedly make the citizens kind and non-violent.
This is their weakness.

#HarkonnenOrdosInfo
Giedi Prime is the home to the Harkonnen.
Do not be fooled by their blind hatred and bloodlust.
They are devious, shrewd, and must be watched carefully!

#OrdosOrdosInfo
The Ordos come from many different homes.
Because of this diversity, we are strong and highly organized.
We know when it is necessary to utilize resources and when to appropriate the required materials.
Our organization is highly efficient and effective.

IX is the technology center of the world.
It is the ultimate source of new, wonderful technology that will help us reach our goals.

#LightFactoryAtreidesInfo
The Light Factory produces lightly armored three and four wheeled vehicles, which are used for the defense of our refineries and silos.

#OutpostAtreidesInfo
The Outpost should be utilized for its radar capability.
The radar will allow you to keep a watchful eye on your harvesters and any enemies in the area.

#PalaceAtreidesInfo
Receiving a Palace is an honor, bestowed only upon those who have displayed bravery and diligence in the completion of their missions.
A Palace is the most finely crafted and well-armored structure you may possess.

The refinery converts spice into credits. Without the refinery you cannot produce new credits by harvesting spice.

#RepairFacilityAtreidesInfo
The Repair facility is used for the repairs of all harvesting and defense vehicles.

#RocketTurretAtreidesInfo
The Rocket turret is an improvement on the regular turret.
Long range rockets have been added to provide for a better perimeter defense system.

#SpiceSilosAtreidesInfo
The Silos are used to store harvested spice.
They are not as strong as some of our other structures, and frequent repairs are advised.

#StarportAtreidesInfo
A Starport will provide us with the ability to trade and deal through intergalactic trading channels. This will allow us to enhance our fleets and structures.

#TurretAtreidesInfo
Turrets are stationary base defenses that are exceptionally accurate at close range.

#WallAtreidesInfo
Walls are the perfect passive defense system.
They should be used to fortify silos and other weak structures.

#WindTrapAtreidesInfo
The Windtraps are an elegant and efficient means of harnessing the wind's awesome power and extracting precious moisture.
Although they are fairly sturdy, you should make sure that you have backup wind traps in case of accidents or sabotage.

#WorAtreidesInfo
WOR is capable of training heavy troopers.
Unlike the other houses, we do not believe in unnecessary violence to achieve our goals, and therefore I do not believe that we will require the use of such technology.

#CarryallAtreidesInfo
The Carryall is capable of transporting the harvester between spice fields and the refinery.
It has no offensive capabilities or weapons, and only light armor.

#CombatTankAtreidesInfo
The Combat Tank is adequately armed and good for defense.
It can be used for perimeter defense and protection of the harvesters.

#HarvesterAtreidesInfo
Harvesters are large and well armored, and can be produced by a heavy factory.
Vital to your spice harvesting missions, they are the only means of collecting and transporting spice from the field to the refinery.

#HeavyTroopersAtreidesInfo
The Heavy troopers are armed with powerful weapons and strong armor.

#LightInfantryAtreidesInfo
The light infantry is satisfactorily protected and adequately armed, and is capable of defending our installations.

#MCVAtreidesInfo
The Mobile Construction Vehicle can be employed to erect new structures that need not be connected to the other buildings in your area.
Additional refineries in outlying areas, for example, would allow you to harvest more effectively.

#OrdosRaiderAtreidesInfo
The Ordos produce a Trike that they call the "Raider".
The "Raider" is much like our own Trike, only it is faster, more maneuverable, and highly agile, yet it has less armor.

#OrnithopterAtreidesInfo
The Ornithopter, a lightly armored, highly maneuverable aircraft, is excellent for defensive air support of your harvesters, trikes, and quads.

#QuadAtreidesInfo
Quads are four wheeled vehicles with strong armor and powerful weapons.
Like the Trike, they are an efficient defense system. With quads and trikes, you should be able to defend against most attacks.

#RocketTankAtreidesInfo
The Rocket Tank has good armor, is faster than normal tanks, and has long range strike capabilities.
It is excellent for defensive support of the light infantry and your squadrons of trikes and quads.

#SiegeTankAtreidesInfo
The Siege Tank is heavily armored and has very powerful weapons.
It is more than adequate to defend your harvesters and installations.

#TrikeAtreidesInfo
The Trike is a three wheeled vehicle produced by the light factory.
It is fast, well armored, and carries light weapons for defense.
Trikes may be utilized for protection against enemy raids and scouting for spice fields.

#DeathHandAtreidesInfo
One of the most destructive weapons on Dune is the Harkonnen missile called the Death Hand.
This multiple explosive warhead affects a wide area and can cause much greater damage than a conventional missile.

#DevastatorAtreidesInfo
This massive tank is one of the newest war machines developed by the Harkonnen.
It has nearly impenetrable armor, enormous firepower, and is capable of destroying nearly any obstacle in its path.

#DeviatorAtreidesInfo
The Deviator fires missiles containing dangerous nerve gas that can seriously distort the perceptions of affected personnel, and may even incite full scale mutinies.

#FremenAtreidesInfo
The native peoples of this planet are excellent guerrilla fighters.
The Fremen are friendly toward us because House Atreides has always dealt with them fairly, and as equals.

#SaboteurAtreidesInfo
The Ordos often employ a band of local terrorist fighters called Saboteurs.
These men are well versed in sabotage, and can easily penetrate defensive perimeters en route to the buildings they intend to destroy.
They should be attacked and killed promptly whenever discovered.

#SandWormAtreidesInfo
These enormous creatures are attracted by vibrations on the surface and will often attack and devour both personnel and vehicles.
Rock is the only sure defense against these creatures.

#SonicTankAtreidesInfo
The Sonic Tank is one of our unique weapons.
It fires a blast of sonic energy rather than projectile weapons.
An excellent weapon for defensive missions, it is especially effective against enemy infantry.

#BarracksHarkonnenInfo
These simple little buildings train infantry units.
The building itself has fair armor and is relatively cheap to maintain. We Harkonnen, however, do not have use for such weak forces.

#ConcreteSlabHarkonnenInfo
Slabs are used to provide stable building foundations.
We have found that anything built on bare rock will deteriorate rapidly.

#ConstructionYardHarkonnenInfo
You must have a construction yard. It will give you the means to construct other buildings.

#HeavyFactoryHarkonnenInfo
You must have a Heavy factory in order to construct our heavy tanks.

#HighTechFactoryHarkonnenInfo
The High-Tech factory produces our carryalls.

#IXHarkonnenInfo
IX will provide you with a source of militarily advanced weapons.

#LightFactoryHarkonnenInfo
The light factory produces only lightly armored vehicles, and is only a beginning step towards your goal of military superiority.

#OutpostHarkonnenInfo
The outpost houses radar equipment.
The radar will help you to keep an eye on your own domain as well as nearby enemy activity.

#PalaceHarkonnenInfo
House Harkonnen may grant a Palace to those who have proved themselves worthy of such an honor.
If you lose a Palace, that was given to you, you will have failed your mission.

#RefineryHarkonnenInfo
The refinery converts harvested spice into credits.

#RepairFacilityHarkonnenInfo
It is impossible to operate machinery in this desert without causing damage.
You must have a repair facility to take care of your damaged vehicles.

#RocketTurretHarkonnenInfo
The Rocket Turret is an excellent weapon.
Although they cannot be moved, they can be utilized for long and short range defense.

#SpiceSilosHarkonnenInfo
Spice silos must be built to be able to store the harvested spice.
Unfortunately, they are weak structures, and must be repaired frequently.

#StarportHarkonnenInfo
The Starport is your link to the storehouses beyond the surface of the planet.
With a Starport at your disposal, you can purchase powerful weapons and vehicles.

#TurretHarkonnenInfo
Turrets are accurate and effective weapons.
Although they are immobile, you should consider them as required enhancements to your forces.

#WallHarkonnenInfo
Walls are an excellent choice for defensive reinforcement.
Like the concrete slabs, walls are inexpensive to produce.

#WindtrapHarkonnenInfo
These are the structures that provide power and water to your installation.
They are a bit fragile, and you are well advised to construct more than one.

#WorHarkonnenInfo
WOR will train the Heavy Troopers.

#CarryallHarkonnenInfo
This transport aircraft can carry large vehicles, such as harvesters, to their destinations more efficiently than letting them wander about on their own.

#CombatTankHarkonnenInfo
The combat tank will be your first tank, and it has adequate armor and fire power.
However, remember that there are more powerful weapons at your disposal.

#HarvesterHarkonnenInfo
This large, slow, and barely maneuverable vehicle is used to harvest raw spice and convey it to the refinery.
Although unarmed, the iron clad harvesters can be used effectively against small groups of infantry by crushing them beneath their treads.

#HeavyTroopersHarkonnenInfo
The Heavy Troopers are superior fighting units.
They are well armored and have powerful weapons.

#LightInfantryHarkonnenInfo
The Light Infantry will hardly suit your needs.
They are slow, poorly armored, and have a tendency to miss their targets.
You should depend upon the more massive troopers.

#MCVHarkonnenInfo
The Mobile Construction Vehicle will allow you to expand your territories.
By using an MCV you will be able to construct distant buildings that need not be adjacent to your principal location.

#OrdosRaiderHarkonnenInfo
This is a pitiful little machine.
For some reason the Ordos believe that this overblown Trike can out maneuver and out fire our Quads.

#OrnithopterHarkonnenInfo
This fragile little aircraft is merely an annoyance.
Their delicate armor is no match for our weapons of war.

#QuadHarkonnenInfo
The Quad is a much better vehicle than the smaller trike.
It has far superior armor and is much more powerful.

#RocketTankHarkonnenInfo
The rocket tank is effective for long range attacks.
Guard these well, for they are ineffective at close range.

#SiegeTankHarkonnenInfo
The Siege Tank is superior to the Combat tank.
It's armor and weaponry has the power you will need to complete your conquest of this planet.

#TrikeHarkonnenInfo
Although these three-wheeled, lightly armored vehicles are functional, we strongly suggest utilizing the larger, more powerful vehicles.

#DeathHandHarkonnenInfo
Our Death Hand is a lovely weapon capable of being targeted for long range strikes.
Just prior to impact it releases a series of explosive fingers that spread destruction over a wide area.

#DevastatorHarkonnenInfo
The Devastator is another of the unique and powerful weapons in our awesome arsenal.
It's armor and weapons are unequaled.
The Devastator need not fear other lesser tanks on the battlefield.

#FremenHarkonnenInfo
The Fremen are little more than slaves to the Atreides.
Ignorant and aboriginal, they occasionally fight for the Atreides, and are provided food and supplies in return.

#OrdosDeviatorHarkonnenInfo
This tank fires a powerful nerve gas that can cause your weaker-willed soldiers to turn against you.

#SaboteurHarkonnenInfo
The Ordos depend upon a band of terrorists called Saboteurs.
If uncontrolled, these cunning little pests will inflict a great deal of damage to your buildings.
I suggest eliminating Saboteurs immediately whenever they are encountered.

#SandWormHarkonnenInfo
These huge native worms are almost impossible to kill.
They are attracted by surface vibrations, and all ground based units are at risk of being devoured.
Rock is the only sure defense against these creatures.

#SonicTankHarkonnenInfo
The Atreides believe that they have found a humane way of eliminating their enemies.
Their Sonic Tank fires shock waves instead of rockets.

#BarracksOrdosInfo
These buildings produce the light infantry, which are some of the most important fighting units in our military system.

#ConcreteSlabOrdosInfo

#OutpostOrdosInfo
The radar capabilities of the outpost are vital to your operations.
With radar, you will be able to monitor the movements of the other Houses and prepare defensive and attack strategies.

#PalaceOrdosInfo
When the House grants you a Palace, you will know that you have pleased them.
If you are ever to lose your Palace to the enemy, your mission will surely be lost.

#RefineryOrdosInfo
The refinery is necessary for the conversion of spice into credits.
Without a refinery, there is no way for you to obtain new credits by harvesting spice.

#RepairFacilityOrdosInfo
If you do not have a repair facility, it will not be possible for you to fix damaged vehicles.
If your damaged vehicles do not receive repairs, you will lose them completely.

#RocketTurretOrdosInfo
The Rocket turret, like the regular turret, cannot be moved.
However, it has greater range capabilities than the regular turret.
Together, these should provide excellent long and short range firing capabilities.

#SpiceSilosOrdosInfo
Silos are used for the storage of spice.
They are weaker and more easily destroyed than harvesters or refineries.
Use this knowledge to your advantage.

#StarportOrdosInfo
The intergalactic purchasing network accessible through the starport will allow you to acquire weaponry in bulk orders.

#TurretOrdosInfo
The turrets are highly accurate weapons.
Their only drawback is that once established, they cannot be moved.

#WallOrdosInfo
Walls may provide for a fair defense around the perimeter of a compound.

#WindtrapOrdosInfo
Windtraps are the only effective source of power on Dune.
Although the traps are fairly strong, they tend to be easily damaged, and it would be wise to always keep more than one wind trap in operation.

#WorOrdosInfo
WOR is the means of producing the heavy troopers.

#CarryallOrdosInfo
The carryall is capable of deploying and retrieving the large tracked vehicles like harvesters.
Using carryalls is far quicker than waiting for the harvester to return on its own.

#CombatTankOrdosInfo
This slow, single barreled tank is adequate in its performance.
However, there are much faster and more efficient tanks available.

#HarvesterOrdosInfo
Harvesters are large, slow vehicles that scout for spice fields and begin harvesting whenever raw spice is found.
Obviously this is a highly inefficient process. We encourage our field commanders to also appropriate previously harvested materials, which is certainly a faster and more efficient method of spice acquisition.

#HeavyTroopersOrdosInfo
The heavy troopers carry more armor and yet are still faster than the light infantry.
Their abilities are well suited for ground assaults and reconnaissance missions.

#LightInfantryOrdosInfo
The light infantry allows for an expendable force of men.
If used in large numbers, they are almost unbeatable.

#MCVOrdosInfo
The Mobile Construction Vehicle offers an efficient means of expanding the territory under your control.
It can provide support for the construction of new facilities at some distance from your existing structures.

#OrdosRaiderOrdosInfo
The Raider is far better than a standard trike.
It is faster and has excellent weapons.
Because of its maneuverability, it is the best vehicle for those missions where you must rely on swiftness and agility.

#OrnithopterOrdosInfo
The ornithopter is a fast and maneuverable, aircraft.
It is effective for strategic strikes, but armor has been sacrificed for speed and agility.

#QuadOrdosInfo
This four-wheeled vehicle is not well suited to our purposes.
Although it has good armor, it is not maneuverable enough and it lacks the speeds we require.

#RocketTankOrdosInfo
Although the Rocket Tank is faster than the combat tank and has long range firing capabilities, we prefer more useful tanks.
I suggest sending your "Raiders" against rocket tanks.

#SiegeTankOrdosInfo
The Siege Tank possesses more than twice the firepower of the combat tank.
Yet, despite all the power and armor, it is quite slow.

#TrikeOrdosInfo
The three wheeled vehicles that other Houses use is lacking in many aspects.
Unlike our Raider, Trikes are unable to maintain the speeds that we demand.
Unfortunately, we had to sacrifice armor for this increase of speed.

#DeathHandOrdosInfo
The Harkonnen possess these missiles that are capable of delivering multiple warheads to a single strike area.
Although fearfully named, fortunately they are also highly inaccurate.

#DevastatorOrdosInfo
The Harkonnen have created this new tank that is capable of inflicting severe damage to even the most well protected vehicles and buildings.
For all its firepower and armor, however, it is extremely slow and may be easily outmaneuvered.

#DeviatorOrdosInfo
Our Deviator fires a nerve gas that is capable of twisting the minds of enemy soldiers.
Some of our best regiments are primarily composed of formerly hostile military personnel who have been reprogrammed by exposure to this gaseous argument.

#FremenOrdosInfo
The native Fremen of Dune are simple but skilled fighters.
They are currently utilized by the Atreides for combat purposes.
Perhaps, with the right incentives, they could be persuaded to join our forces instead.

#SaboteurOrdosInfo
The Saboteur is the group name given to this unit of soldiers specializing in sabotage.
They are effective for specific target destruction, and are based at all of our Palaces.

#SandWormOrdosInfo
Indigenous to the sands of Dune, these monsters are attracted by vibrations, and can destroy large vehicles in a single bite.
Rock is the only sure defense against these creatures.

#SonicTankOrdosInfo
The Atreides have developed a Sonic Tank that fires sonic blasts instead of projectiles.
Be careful around these, their blasts have long range effects.
