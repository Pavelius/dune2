Houses
 House Atreides: FARTR.WSA*Caladan: Our ancestral home is the lush planet of Caladan. We have created a civilized society and we respect the lives and rights of all people. We do not believe in the use of unnecessary violence, and have crafted a defensive alliance with the native Fremen of Dune. 
 House Harkonnen: FHARK.WSA*Giedi Prime: The Harkonnen come from the dark planet of Giedi Prime. They are cruel and vicious individuals, and do not assign much value to fair play or even human life. Their goal is obviously the military conquest of Dune. 
 House Ordos: FORDOS.WSA*Name: Unknown House Ordos was originally formed by a group of insecure wealthy families. It has evolved into a powerful cartel that is driven by a lust for credits and the desire to control and manipulate. They often support themselves by stealing rather than working. 
Structures

Although they are fairly sturdy, you should make sure that you have backup wind traps in case of accidents or sabotage. 
 Wor: wor.wsa*Trooper BarracksPower Needs: 20 WOR is capable of training heavy troopers. Unlike the other houses, we do not believe in unnecessary violence to achieve our goals, and therefore  I do not believe that we will require the use of such technology.

Specials

 Fremen: Fremen.wsa*FremenMobility: FootFirepower: Medium The native peoples of this planet are excellent guerrilla fighters. The Fremen are friendly toward us because House Atreides has always dealt with them fairly, and as equals. 
 Saboteur: saboture.wsa*SaboteurMobility: FootFirepower: Unknown The Ordos often employ a band of local terrorist fighters called Saboteurs. These men are well versed in sabotage, and can easily penetrate defensive perimeters en route to the buildings they intend to destroy. They should be attacked and killed promptly whenever discovered. 
 Sand Worm: Worm.wsa*Shai-HuludNo Known Weakness These enormous creatures are attracted by vibrations on the surface and will often attack and devour both personnel and vehicles. Rock is the only sure defense against these creatures. 
 Sonic Tank: stank.wsa*Sonic TankMobility: TrackedFirepower: Heavy The Sonic Tank is one of our unique weapons. It fires a blast of sonic energy rather than projectile weapons. An excellent weapon for defensive missions, it is especially effective against enemy infantry.
